# Ticking Away Valorant

## Verse 1
# Ticking Away

I need to keep you around, with my feet tied  
With my feet tied tight to the ground  
The end's nowhere to be found, I don't know why  
You don't leave me to drown, oh, oh, oh  

Don't know where to go unless you say  
Don't know what to do unless you stay  
Thinking that today will be our day  
Be our day again  

Why am I playing with time as it's ticking away?  
It's tickin' away, away, I'm asking  
Why we run for our lives, not a second to waste?  
You're tickin' away, away, away  

Alright, let's get it  
Winnin' (winnin'), losin' (losin'), either way I'm there  
Gotta attitude, I'm out the roof up in the air  
This round I make it count, yeah, I'm talkin' right now  
Feel like the comeback kid, I got no time to spare  

Woah, double up the score, turn a two to a four  
You know I win a lot, gotta win one more  
On a hot streak, never gets old  
Solo with the ace, and my team went gold  

Why am I playing with time as it's ticking away?  
It's tickin' away, away, I'm asking  
Why we run for our lives, not a second to waste?  
You're tickin' away, away, away  

You're ticking away, away, away  
You're ticking away, away  
I'll give it one more try  
I don't know why, but I keep coming back every time  
I want it more than my life  
I don't know why, but it feels so right  

Why am I playing with time as it's ticking away?  
It's tickin' away, away, I'm asking  
Why we run for our lives, not a second to waste?  
It's tickin' away, away, away  

It's ticking away, away, away  
Ticking away, away, away
