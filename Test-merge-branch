# Ticking Away Valorant

## Verse 1
A world of agents, guns in hand,
Battlegrounds, where they take a stand,
Rifles loaded, abilities in play,
In Valorant, we'll seize the day.

## Pre-Chorus
Bombs are planted, fuses set,
Tension rising, hearts in a bet,
Enemies lurking, in every lane,
We'll fight together, no pain, no gain.

## Chorus
Ticking away in Valorant's dance,
One shot, one chance, in this tactical trance,
Running and gunning, with strategy clear,
Valorant's battlegrounds, we'll conquer our fear.

## Verse 2
Maps evolving, with pathways unknown,
Agents unite, their skills brightly shown,
Spike carriers pushing, through fire and smoke,
Victory's sweet taste, with every round we provoke.

## Pre-Chorus
Bullets rain down, abilities clash,
In this tactical shooter, we make our own path,
With courage and teamwork, we rise to the fight,
Valorant's calling, ignites our might.

## Chorus
Ticking away in Valorant's dance,
One shot, one chance, in this tactical trance,
Running and gunning, with strategy clear,
Valorant's battlegrounds, we'll conquer our fear.

## Bridge
From Haven to Bind, the battles persist,
Side by side, we'll never desist,
Headshots and aces, our legacy grows,
In Valorant's world, our true colors show.

## Chorus
Ticking away in Valorant's dance,
One shot, one chance, in this tactical trance,
Running and gunning, with strategy clear,
Valorant's battlegrounds, we'll conquer our fear.

## Outro
As the clock ticks down, we hold the line,
Valorant's spirit, forever intertwined,
In the realm of agents, we'll forever play,
Ticking away Valorant, in the heat of the fray.
